## Introduction
The house has 2 main floors and a garage. It has a lot of smart devices, most of them work directly through the House Agent, and some of them have their own agent. 

The aim is to have a smart house, but looking also for costs, electricity and consumes. In order to save money and to help in the explained aim, on the rooftop there are solar panels and a photovoltaic system. 

The house is reachable also from people with disability, thanks to the presence of an elevator, and the absence of stairs inside the house and between the rooms.
